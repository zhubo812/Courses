## 第十三章 英语惯用法及其翻译

@@@
### 1. It的造句

1. it...不定式
2. it...for...不定式
3. it...动名词
4. it...子句
5. it is...子句 
6. it...名词
~~~~
1. it...不定式
- It is wrong to tell a lie.（撒谎是不对的。）
- 这种形式上的主语或宾语，是中文表现法中所没有的。这些句子的真正的主语或宾语移到后面去了，而不在原来的地位上，于是那里就产生一个空缺，只得用“it”填补上去，所以这个“it”，英文就叫做填补词（expletive）。
~~~~
1. It was glorious to acquire a place by justice, yet more glorious to prefer justice before a place.

2. I have my own views about learning a language.I think it waste of time to acquire a greater knowledge than suffices me to read fluently and talk enough for the ordinary affairs of life.（Maugham）

3. How far cards might have helped him here it is difficult to say.（Hugh Walpole）
~~~~
2. it...for...不定式
- It is difficult for him to do so.（要他这样做是有困难的。）
- 这是属于“it...不定词”同一形式的，“it”仍然是代表不定词的形式上的主语或宾语。翻译时必须把句中的不定词看作主动词，因为介词“for”的宾语是不定词的意味上的主语（sense subject），即宾语的“him”应译成主语才是。如果我们把填补词的“it”去掉，恢复原来应有的形式时，便成 To do so is difficult for him.这个“for him”，也可译成中文的“在他”，全句译为“要这样做，在他是有困难的”。但不如把“him”当作主语来译更加利落。
~~~~
1. It is so very difficult for a sick man not to be a scoundrel.
2. It is not supposed to be easy for women to rise to the height of taking the large free view of anything—anything which calls for action.
3. It is foolish of him to set himself to perform an impossibility.
~~~~
3. it...动名词
- It is no use talking about it.（空谈无益。）
- “It is no use+Gerund”＝“It is of no use+Infinitive”，可译作“无益”或“无用”。这个形式上的主语是和代表不定词一样，是代表后面的动名词的。二者所不同的，就是后接不定词的前面要用形容词，后接动名词的前面才用名词。因为依照惯用语法，只能说 It is useless （＝of no use） to protest.不能说 It is no use to protest.所以我们如果要把例句中的“talking”改为“to talk”时，前面说的“no use”那个名词，就得改为“of no use”的形容词才行。It is no use doing.＝It is no good doing sth.There is no doing.＝It is impossible to do.
- 例如 There is no knowing what may happen.（未来的事是不可能知道的。）
~~~~
- It is no use your trying to deceive me.（你别想欺骗我。）
- It is no use my arguing with you.（我用不着和你争论。）
- It is worth while asking how far their education contributed to their success.
~~~~
1. It is no good talking about the greatness of our country, unless we do something to make it great.
2. It is worth while asking how far their education contributed to their success.
3. You must find it rather dull living here all by yourself.
~~~~
4. it...子句
- It is true that he went there.(他去了那里是真的。)
- 这是“it...不定词”的一种变形，形式上的主语或宾语所代表的，在此句型中便是后面的子句（that-Clause）。这两种句型差不多都是可以随时变换的，单句变成复句，复句也可以变成单句，
- 例如：I have some purchases that I must make.（to make）（我要买些东西。）
~~~~
1. It is true the Chinese attitude is to a large degree a reaction to the behaviour of the West，so that the latter must be taken into account，and will frequently be criticized.

2. It is hoped that men will be honest，but from a higher motive than because honesty is the best policy.
~~~~
5. it is...子句 
- It is diligence that makes up for deficiency.(勤能补拙。)
- 这和上项所说的“it...子句”完全不同，因为这个“it”不是代表后面的子句的。这是一种加重语气的说法。句中关系代名词的先行词，须与后接附属子句中的动词在数、性、人称上保持一致。这种关系代名词是属于限制性的（restrictive），自应以用“that”为宜，不过常被换上“who”，“which”来说，也是可以的，而且甚至有将关系代名词略去的。
~~~~
- It is only shallow people who judge by appearances.（Oscar wilde）（只有浅薄的人才会以貌取人。）
- It is a kind of miracle brought us here.（Bacon）（我们来到这里，简直是一种奇迹。）

~~~~
1. It is an ill wind that blows nobody good.
2. Yet it is not he who sings loudest and jokes most that has the lightest heart.（Irving）
3. It is the want of money and need of it that gives most of us activitacy.
4. Reading furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge；it is thinking that makes what we read ours.
5. Most large companies have trained specialists，called personnel managers，whose job it is to interview and pass judgment on prospective employees.
~~~~
6. it...名词
- It is strange this Norse view of Nature.(挪威人对大自然的这种看法是很奇怪的。)
- 这个“it”是代表后面的名词的，在名词的前面，经常伴有“this”“that”“the”的字样。上例去掉形式上的“it”，恢复原来的说法，便是 This Norse view of Nature is strange.不过一般人说时，都喜欢采用 It is strange...的形式。我们不可误会这是“it...子句”型，省略了“that”的，试看下面的类例，便无法把“that”加进去。
~~~~
1. It is strange the number of mistakes he always makes.
2. It’s so dreadful，her father and mother dead almost at the same time.
3. He wondered if it was true what Mabel had said.

### 2. 名词的造句

1. “all+抽象名词”或“抽象名词+ itself”＝very+形容词
2. “the +单数名词”的特殊用法
3. 无生物的主语
4. something （much） of，nothing （little） of
5. 属格的主格作用和宾格作用
6. 名词（A）+of+a+名词（B）
7. 名词+of+属格+名词
8. of+抽象名词＝形容词，of 从略+普通名词
9. one’s own+名词，of one’s own+动名词
10. have+the+抽象名词+不定词
11. that（those）+先行词+关系代名词
12. one thing ... another
 
~~~~

1. “all+抽象名词”或“抽象名词+ itself”＝very+形容词
- He was all gentleness to her.(他对她非常的亲切。)
- “all+抽象名词”＝“抽象名词 + itself”＝ very +形容词。这原是表示某种性质到了极点的一种说法，有“非常”，“只管”，“一味”，“尽”之意，有时甚至可以译为“…的化身”，“…的具体化”。普通名词的复数形用在“all”之后，也是属于这一类型的句子。
- 如 She is all smiles.（她一味笑。）He is all eyes.（他盯着看。）
~~~~
1. “I am all astonishment，” said Nelson，“when I reflect on what we have achieved.”

2. Washington was discretion itself in the use of speech，never taking advantage of an opponent，or seeking a short-lived triumph in a debate.

3. While she was waiting for the tinkling of the bell，all nerves，suddenly he stood before her.
~~~~
2. “the +单数名词”的特殊用法
- The pen is mightier than the sword.（文笔比刀剑更要强而有力。/文胜于武）
- 定冠词的“the”与单数普通名词结合时，有下列五种用法：（1）特定之物（particularizing），（2）集合复数（collective），（3）代表性的单数（representative），如（a）例，（4）代替抽象名词（abstractive），即指那个名词所有的抽象的观念，如（b）例，（5）定性的用法（qualitative），代替“such”或“so”的字样，用于普通名词或是抽象名词都可以。现在就根据这五种用法举例如下：
~~~~
- Shut the door please.（请把门关上。）（1）

- The cabinet has resigned.（内阁辞职了。）（1）

- I am going to the station.（我上车站去。）（附近的）（1）
~~~~
- They are the teachers of our school.（他们是本校的教员。）（全体）（2）

- The stars are out.（星星出来了。）（常见的）（2）

- The cherry trees are in blossom.（樱花开了。）（附近所有的樱花）（2）
~~~~
- The gentleman glories in his honourable poverty.（君子安贫。）（乐于清贫，“the”表其类全体的性质或作用。）（3）

- The whale is not a fish，but a mammal.（鲸不是鱼，而是哺乳动物。）（3）

- Bitters are good for the stomach.（苦味有益于胃。）（3）

- The face is the index of the mind.（面情为心情的表征。）（3）
~~~~

- The heart sees farther than the head.（情有胜于智的先见。）（4）

- We must keep the wolf from the door.（＝keep hunger away）（我们必须防止饥饿。）（4）
~~~~

- He is not the boy to （＝such a boy as will） tell a lie.（他不是说谎的孩子。）（5）

- He had the goodness （＝was so good as） to grant my request.（他亲切地允许了我的请求。）（5）
~~~~
3. 无生物的主语
- Business took me to the town.(我因事进城去了。)
- 中国话对于每个句子，差不多都是用人作主语，很少用无生物的。英文本也可以用人作主语，但用无生物作主语，却使得英文的气味更加浓厚。上例当然也可以说，I went to the town on business.不过不及用无生物主语来得漂亮。有时为避免把人转入，用无生物主语则更为含蓄，如不说 We request，而说 It is requested，便觉得是间接的要求了。
~~~~
例如 
- It is requested that every guest should bring a gift with him for exchange.（每位客人请携带一件礼物以便交换。）
- Contributions are requested for the refugees.（为难民呼吁捐款救济。）
- 与无生物主物同用的动词，主要有 make，enable，remind，prevent，show，bring，keep 等字。
~~~~
1. His work made it impossible for him to get home oftener than every other weekend.

2. Machinery had made the products of manufactories very much cheaper than formerly.

3. My hunger and the shadows together tell me that the sun has done much travel since I fell asleep.
~~~~
4. something （much） of，nothing （little） of
- Mr. Li is something of a philosopher.(李先生有哲学家的风味。)
- Mr. Wu is nothing of a musician.（吴先生全无音乐家的风味。）

~~~~
这是表示“程度”的形容词片语，有时可以当作副词来译。“something of”＝to some extent（某程度），在问句或条件句中，则说“anything of”，中文可译为“略有”，“多少”。至于“nothing of”，则可译为“全无”，“毫无”。“to be something of+名词”＝“to have something of+名词+in+代名词”，所以 He is something of a philosopher.＝He has something of a philosopher in him.又 He is nothing in ability of an orator.＝He has nothing of an orator in his ability.（他毫无演说家的才能。）
~~~~
- That’s too much of a good thing.（那事好过了头，反而糟了。）

- He is very much of a gentleman.（他是一个非常体面的绅士。）

- He is more of a scholar than a teacher.（与其说他是教师，不如说他是学者。）
~~~~
5. 属格的主格作用和宾格作用
- No one came to my mother’s rescue.（谁也不来救助我的母亲。）

- The love of money is the root of all evil.（爱财是一切罪恶的根源。）
~~~~
- 英文属格的用法，都有主格作用和宾格作用的分别，要看语境才能决定是哪一种。由他动词变来的名词，差不多都有这两种用法。
- “the government of the people,by the people and for the people”，句中的“of the people”一语，到底是主格作用呢，还是宾格作用，颇引起意义上的争执，因为它可以解释为（1）“人民治理的”（主格作用），也可以解释为（2）“治理人民的”（宾格作用），到底是何者只好去问林肯本人了。
~~~~
- Caesar’s conquest of Britain（宾格作用）

- The writings of Plato（主）

- The writing of a book（宾）

- The commands of the general（主）

- The command of an army（宾）

- John’s fear（约翰所怀的恐怖）

- The fear of John （恐怕约翰的心情）

- Your dismissal of him（主）

- Your dismissal by him（宾）
~~~~
6. 名词（A）+of+a+名词（B）
- It was a great mountain of a wave.（那是一个像山一样高的大浪。）
- That fool of a Tom did it.（这是汤姆那个笨蛋做的。）
- 这叫作同格的属格（Appositive Possessive），在“of”前后的名词，指同一人或同一物。其中的“名词+of”，构成一个形容词片语，以修饰后来的名词。在这个同格的“of”后出现的名词前面，必须加不定冠词，哪怕是固有名词，这个不定冠词都不能省。
~~~~
- That old cripple of a Henn.（Sean O’Faolain）（那个年老的残废者亨。）

- She was much better educated than that fool of a Beatrice.（A.Huxley）（她比那愚笨的比特里斯受过更好的教育。）

- This huge lunatic warren of a London.（J.B.Priestley）（这个巨大狂人收容所一般的伦敦。）
~~~~
- Those pigs of girls eat so much.（那些猪一般的女子吃那么多。）

- He was a fine figure of a young man.（他是一个翩翩佳公子。）
~~~~
7. 名词+of+属格+名词
- It was beyond expectation for a man of your taste.(遇到一位像你这样有风趣的人，真是出乎意外。)
- 在“名词+of+属格+名词”的形式中，其属格的含义为:“像……那样的”。
~~~~
- He is a man of your experience.（他是一个像你那样经验丰富的人。）

- I am not a man of his means.（我不是他那样的资产家。）

- You are a lady of her wisdom.（你是一个像她那样贤慧的淑女。）
~~~~
8. of+抽象名词＝形容词，of 从略+普通名词

- It was of great importance.（这是非常重要的。
）
- The earth is the shape of a pear.（地球是梨子形的。）
~~~~
- 在第一个句子中“of +抽象名词”的形式，是和形容词同义的。如“of importance”＝important.“of use”＝useful.“of no use”＝useless.这都是可以译为“…的”的，如“a man of courage”＝a courageous man（勇敢的人;勇士）。“a lady of virtue”＝a virtuous lady（贤德的女人，淑女）。他如“ a child of fortune”（幸运儿）。“a man of business”（实业家）。用普通名词也是一样，如“a man of family”（名门之子）。“a man of few words”（寡言的人）。“a man of his word”（言行一致的人）。
~~~~
- Bernard Shaw was an Englishman of letters.（萧伯纳是英国的文人。）

- Su Tung-po was a man of parts.（苏东坡是多才多艺的人。）

- He is a man of means.（他是资产家。）

- Chu Ko-lian was a man of resources.（诸葛亮足智多谋。）
~~~~
9. one’s own+名词，of one’s own+动名词
- He shines his own shoes.(他自己擦皮鞋。)

- It is a tree of his own planting.(这是他手栽的树。)
~~~~
- 英文说的“one’s own”，除“自己的”一个意思外，还有“为自己”一个意思，即英文“by oneself”的意思，如,He shines his own shoes.＝His shoes are shined by himself.原来“own”是加强的说法，单说 That is his house.（那是他的家）已经够了，但要加强时便说 That is his own house.单说 He has a house.（他有一幢房子）也够明白了,但要加强时就说 He has a house of his own.（他自己有一幢房子）。要注意的是：不能说 He has his own house.因为现代英文不可以把属格代名词和指示代名词连用，即是：不能说“this my （own） house”，而要说“this house of mine”，或“this house of my own”，因此惯用法就要说 He has a house of his own.尤其是在动词“have”之后。（b）例的“of one’s own doing”，意为“自己做的”（done by oneself），往往可省略“own”一字，如“a tree of his own planting”也可以说成“a tree of his planting.”
~~~~
- She has no children of her own.（她自己没有生孩子。）

- The moon has no light of its own.（月亮本身无光）

- It is a poem of his own composing.（＝It is a poem composed by himself.）（这是他自己做的诗。）
~~~~
10. have+the+抽象名词+不定词
- I had the fortune to succeed.(我很幸运获得成功。)

- 这个 have＝possess，原指肉体上或精神上的特征，作为一种天禀而具有的，比方说，He has a good memory.（他的记性好）。又如 Irishmen have red hair.（爱尔兰人天生是红头发）。进而由普通名词发展为抽象名词，后面接上一个不定词，而成为一种惯用的语法了。例如 She had the cheek （＝impudence） to say such a thing.（她厚颜地说出这样的话。）这就等于说：She was so impudent as to say such a thing.
~~~~
- I had the luck to find him at home.（我幸运地遇见他正在家里。）

- He had the misfortune to break his leg.（他不幸折断了腿。）

- Those who have the interest of their country at heart are praiseworthy.（忧国之士值得颂扬。）
~~~~
11. that（those）+先行词+关系代名词
- He lost that picture which he had got with much trouble.(他把那费了很大的劲才得来的画丢了。)

- 这是所谓“强烈的限制”（strong restriction）用法，即是为加强限制的意思，在“who”，“which”的先行词（Antecedent）前加用“that”，“those”的字眼。这种表现法和说“such...as”差不多。句中的“that”，不能译为“那个”。
~~~~
- The root is that part of the vegetable which least impresses the eye.（根是植物最不引人注目的部分。）

- That virtue which requires to be ever guarded is scarcely worth the sentinel.（＝Such virtue as requires…）（需要常常保护的美德是不值得看守的。）

- Those rich men are great who do not think themselves great because they are rich.（并不以为他们有钱就是伟大的阔人们，才算伟大。）
~~~~
12. one thing ... another
- It is one thing to know and another to teach.(自己知道是一件事，要教别人又是另外一件事。)
- 这个例句又可简约地说 To know is one thing;to teach is another.（＝Knowing and teaching are different.）意即自知和教人是两回事，有的人知道但不能教，虽有一肚子学问却不会教书。“another”＝an+other.“one...another”不可与“one...the other”以及“the one...the other”混乱。在二者之中任取其一（one），剩下的便是另外的一个了（the other）。
~~~~
- It is one thing to own a library；it is another to use it wisely.（藏书是一件事，能否善于利用又是另外一件事。）

- To have money is one thing，to spend it wisely is quite another.（有钱是一件事，贤明地用钱又是另外一件事。）

- It is one thing to know a language，and it is another to know about it.（懂得一种语文是一件事，具有关于那种语文的知识又是另外一件事。）
@@@
### 3. As 的造句
~~~~
#### 1. “as...as”的三种用法

- He is as kind as his sister （is）.他像他妹妹一样和蔼。
- He is as kind as （he is） honest.他又诚实又和蔼。
- He is as kind as his sister is honest.他妹妹诚实而他就和蔼。
~~~~
英文“as+形容词+as”的形式，是表示程度相同的某种性质的，如例1，表示两个不同的人相同的性质，例2表示同一人的不同的性质，例3表示两个人的不同的性质。句中第一个“as”为指示副词，第二个“as”为连词，因此在第一个“as”后面，只能接用一个形容词或副词，而在第二个“as”后面，便要接上一个子句。如系否定时则第一个“as”改为“not so”，例如 He is not so kind as you are.
~~~~
- He is as clever as his sister.（他和他姊姊一样聪明。）

- She is not so pretty as her sister.（她没有她妹妹好看。）

- No country suffered so much as England.（Macaulay）（没有一个国家受过英格兰那样多的痛苦。）

- He is as cunning as you are clever.（他的狡猾好似你的聪明。）


~~~~
1. He is as old as his cousin.
2. He was as covetous as cruel.
3. Dobbin looked as pale and grave as his comrade was flushed and jovial.

~~~~

#### 2. as...as any，as...as ever
- He is as great a statesman as any.

- He is as great a statesman as ever lived.

- 他是一位稀有的大政治家。
~~~~
- 英文的“as...as”原为同等比较的意思，加上“any”或“ever”的时候，就变成“不让”，“不弱”，甚至“古今无双的”的意思了。在“as ... as any”后面，又可以接上名词，如 He works as hard as anybody.（他勤勉不逊于任何人。）如果在“any”后接物而不接人，则有“as...as anything can be”（＝as...as possible）一个表现法，意为“愈…愈佳”，如 I will make it as clean as anything can be.（我要尽量把它弄清洁。）这个“as...as ever”，另外又有“as...as before”（照旧）的意思，如 He works as hard as ever.（其勤勉不减于以前。）He is as busy as ever.（他照旧忙。）She is as pretty as ever.（她还是一样的漂亮。）这个“ever”＝always.（素常。）
~~~~
- His behaviour is as good as ever.（他的行为和过去一样的好。）

- His trust in his friend was as firm as ever.（他对其朋友的信任照常坚定。）

- He is as diligent a man as ever lived.（其为人勤勉不让古今的人。）

1. His novels have as good a chance of surviving as any that have been written in the last hundred years.

2. It’s not only real，but it’s as fine a string of pearls for its size as I’ve ever seen. 
~~~~
#### 3. as...as...can be
- It is as plain as plain can be.那是再明白也没有了。
- 上例单说是 It is plain.也就够了，现在为要加强“plain”的意思，所以把同一个形容词再说一遍，最后再加上“can be”的字样，表示“明白到不能再明白的程度”。这种表现法有时可将第一个“as”省掉，或将“can be”略去。这个“can be”，有时也可说成“may be”的。
~~~~
- You are as wrong as wrong can be.（你大错特错。）
- A lot of these boys were green as green can be.（这些男孩子许多都是精力充沛无以复加的。）

- Gabby yanked him quick as quick.（加比急急地把他用力猛拉。）

- I am as thirsty as thirsty may be.（我口渴得不得了。）

- She is as happy as happy can be.（她快乐已极。）

- The place is as still as still.（那地方静寂得无以复加。）
~~~~
1. “Thou’rt wrong,my friend，” said good King Hal;“as wrong as wrong can be.” 

2. The old folks made me welcome;they were as kind as kind could be.

3. Since I have been in prison he has always been coming to see me，and at times he would talk to me，and was as good to me as could be.


~~~~
#### 4. as...，so...

- As rust eats iron, so care eats the heart.忧能伤人，亦犹锈之蚀铁。
- 这个“so”的意思是“in the same proportion”，“in like manner”，“in the same way”（亦复如此）。为着加强语气，又可在“as”前加用“just”一字。有时在主句中，可将动词置于主语之前。
~~~~
- As you treat me，so I will treat you.（你怎样待我，我也怎样待你。）

- As the lion is king of beasts,so is the eagle king of birds.（鹰为鸟中之王，正好像狮为兽中之王一样。）

- As fire tries gold，so does adversity try courage.（正如火可以试金一样，逆境也可以试人的勇气。）- 


~~~~
1. Just as no two words are truly synonyms，so no two different expressions，or ways of expression,can mean exactly the same thing.

2. Just as the chemist draws his deductions from the results of laboratory experiments，so must students of language draw their deductions from an observation of the facts of language.


~~~~
#### 5. It is in （or with）...as in （or with）
- It is in life as in a journey.人生好比旅行一样。
- 这个表现法是由“as...so”（正像）变化而来的，意为“is like”，可译作“犹如”，“正好像”。例句可说成 Life is like a journey.句首的“it”，并不指什么，只是一般漠然的用法。

~~~~
- It is in studying as in eating；he who does it gets the benefits,and not he who sees it done.（读书和吃饭一样，得到利益的是实际在吃的人，而不是在旁观看的人。）

~~~~
1. It is in man as in soils,where sometimes there is a vein of gold which the owner knows not of.

2. It is with words as with sunbeams；the more they are condensed，the deeper they burn.
~~~~
#### 6. as much，as many，like so many
- I thought as much.我亦作如是想。

- Those five days seemed to me as many years.那个五天对我好像五年一样。

- They work like so many ants.那些人就像那么多的蚂蚁一样在做工。
~~~~
- 这个“as much”＝as much as that,具有三种意思：
1. “the same degree or quantity of”,表同样程度的，同样分量的，例如 He has gold as much as silver.（他有与白银同样多的黄金。）
1. “as well”；“equally”，表同等或同样的，例如 He was greatly respected，and his brother as much despised.（他很受人尊敬，而他的兄弟则很受人鄙视。）
1. “the same thing”;“just so”,表同一事；意为“亦然”，例如 I was not at all vexed at my failure，for I had expected as much.（我对失败一点也不烦恼，因为我早知道会失败的。）
~~~~
#### 7. as good as，as well as
1. It is as good as done.这就和做好了一样。
1. It is broad as well as long.那既长且宽。
~~~~
##### “as good as”有两个意思：
1. “amounting to”;“not falling short of”，意为“等于”，“同样”，“几如”，“不欠缺”，例如 He was as good as his word.（他不爽约。实践其言。）（句中“word”换为“promise”也是一样。）
2. “virtually”；“essentially”；“in every essential respect”，意为“实际上”，“其实”,“实在”，“在各要点上”，例如 He is as good as dead already.（宛如死人。行尸走肉。名存实亡。他简直和死人一样。）
~~~~
1. The merchant as good as promised the orphan boy，that he would adopt him.（那商人等于是答应了那孤儿要收他为养子。）

#### 8. 句首的“as it is”，句尾的“as it is”
1. If I were rich，I should do so. As it is，I do nothing.如果我有钱的话，我就要这样做。但实在太穷，我什么都不能做。
1. The painter does not copy nature as it is.画家描绘大自然，并不是完全写实的。
~~~~
- 英文说的“as it is”（过去时态为“as it was”）这个表现法，有两种场合，因用的位置不同，而影响到意义的差别。
- 用于句首，接在假设语气之后。例如 If I were a college graduate，I would go abroad.As it is，I cannot go.（如果我是大学毕业生的话，我就要出洋去。但事实上，我可不能去。）这个“as it is”＝as it stands；to state the matter as it really stands； as a matter of fact；in reality，意为“在事实上”，“就实际的情形而论”，简略成为“实际上”，“事实上”。
~~~~
- 用于句尾，接在名词或代名词之后。例如 I take the world as it is.（世界就是这个样子，我并不指望它会变好。）Leave it as it is.（就让它是那样，不要动好了。）You has better take things as they are.（你最好接受事物的现状。）这个“as it is”（复数为“as they are”），意为“照现状”，“it”指前面的名词，所以那名词如为复数时，就要改为“they”，动词也跟着要改为“are”。
~~~~
1. If he were not ill，he would go to see the play.As it is，he has to stay at home.（如果他不生病的话，他是要去看戏的。实际上，他只好呆在家里了。）
2. Please leave the apple-box as it is.（请把苹果箱照原样放着。）
~~~~
1. There is no alleviation for the sufferings of mankind except veracity of thought and action and the resolute facing of the world as it is.

2. I should have followed him through the open window if I had been stronger.As it was，I rang the bell and roused the house.
~~~~
#### 9. 过去分词+as it is，现在分词+as it does
1. Hidden as it was by the trees，the tomb was difficult to find.深藏在树木中，那坟墓很难找到。

1. Standing as it does on a high hill，the church commands a fine view.像这样建立在高山上，教堂的眺望很好。
~~~~
- 这是上项用法的变形。这个“as it is”（过去用“was”）是强调前面的过去分词的，“it”是指主句中的主语，在上例中则指“the tomb”，如果不要加强来说，则取消“as it was”，说成 Hidden by the trees,the tomb was difficult to find.意思还是一样。
~~~~
- 在过去分词之后所接的“as it is”，到了现在分词之后，就要把动词“be”改为“do”；这个“as it does”也好，前述的“as it is”也好，都是为加重语气而设的插入句，去掉它也是无妨的，例2改说成 Standing on a high hill，the church commands a fine view.意思还是一样的。这个在现在分词后接用的“as it does”（或“as he does”；“as she did”等），可译为“因为是这样”，“实际…故”等等。

~~~~
1. Written as it is in good English，this book is recommendable to all.（实际是用美好的英文写的，所以这本书可以向大众推介。）

1. Burdened as he was，he could not walk fast.（因为负荷太重，所以他不能走快。）

3. Coming as it did at a period of exceptional dullness it attracted perhaps rather more attention than it deserved.
~~~~
#### 10. 名词等+as+主语+动词等
1. Child as she was，she was more than a match for him.她虽是一个小孩，却甚过做他的对手。
1. Strange as it may sound, it is true.听来虽觉奇怪，却是千真万确的。
1. Try as you may，you will never succeed.你尽可以试试看，不过你决不会成功。
~~~~
在“名词（形容词）+as+主语+动词”的形式中的“as”，如例1及2，多为“though”或“although”的意思，是一种表示让步的句子，上例可改写为 Though she was a child（注意这时要加上冠词）及 Although it may sound strange.至于“动词+as+主语+助动词”的形式，也是让步的说法。Try as you may＝Although you may try.
~~~~
1. Clever as he was，he found not a little difficuty in solving the problem which was anything but difficult.（他虽很聪明，也很难来解决那个决非困难的问题。）

1. Clever as he was，he found little difficulty in solving the problem which was none too easy.（他因为很聪明，所以一点不困难，就把那个决非容易的问题解决了。）

- Clever as he was＝Although he was clever.

- Clever as he was＝As he was clever.
~~~~
1意为“虽然”，2意为“因为”。这个“as”何时作“虽然”解，何时作“因为”解，就要看后面的文句才能决定。这是由“（as） clever as he is”强调的省略而来，“像他那样聪明”，变成“他虽则聪明”。
~~~~
1. Young as he is，it is but natural that he should commit such a mistake.（他因为年轻，要犯这种错误也是当然的事。）

1. Woman as she is,she was brave.（她虽是女流，那时却够勇敢了。）

2. Struggle as we may，we can never be completely satisfied.

### 4. 动词造句
~~~~
#### 1. may well+动词，and well+主语+may
1. He may well be proud of his success.他获得那样的成功是很可以骄傲的。
1. He is proud of his success，and well he may.他对于自己的成功感到骄傲，也是应该的。
~~~~
在例1中的“may well”＝have good reason（其中的“well”＝with good reason＝reasonably），意为“**有理由**”，“**无怪**”。在例中2的“well+主语+may”＝ and with reason，附在主句之后，意为“那也是应该的”。这个“well”是修饰整个句子的副词，以表示说话者的意见的。有时不说“may”，单用一个“well”，也能表达“with good reason”的意思，如 We cannot very well refuse him.（我们没有好的理由来拒绝他。）内容如果是指的过去的话，“may”则可改为过去时态的“might”，不过有时候，用过去时态的“might”，并不一定是指过去，而是一种客气的说法，用来表现在的，如 She might well ask that.（她这样问一声，也不为无理吧。）


~~~~
1. She may well be proud of her son.（她对她自己的儿子感到骄傲，是有理由的。）

1. You may well say so.（你很有理由这样说。）

1. You may as well call a cat a little tiger as call a tiger a big cat.你如把虎叫做大猫，同样也无妨把猫叫做小虎。
1. You might as well throw your money away as spend it in gambling.你要把钱花在赌博上，就不如丢掉的好。
~~~~
- “may as well...as”和“might as well...as”，都是用于现在的，并无现在时和过去时的分别，其所不同的是前者指“可能的事”，而后者指“不可能的事”。这种句中的“well”，也和“may well”中的“well”意思相同，都是作“合理的”，“**理所当然的**”,所以“may as well...as”＝have as good reason to...as，不过这个表现法中的意义的重点，在“as...as”之间的比较，有时可解释为“与其…做，宁肯…做为佳”，如 One may as well not know a thing at all as know it imperfectly.（与其一知半解，不如完全不知的好。）

- 例2这种“as...as”的造句，原意为比较，即...和...一样,但有时可采用选择的译法：“与其那样不如这样的好”。在第二个“as”后的字句，常被省略，因为由前面的文字可以想像出来。
~~~~
1. You might as well throw your money into the sea as lend it to him.（你借钱给他，不啻把钱丢在海里。）

1. I might as well act it as say it.（我那样说就等于那样做。）
